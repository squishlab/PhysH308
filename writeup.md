# Reading notes:

The goal of your reading notes is to build a personal summary of the course content.  Writing good notes will help you confirm your understanding, improve your retention, and give you an opportunity to reflect critically about the course material.  I will assess based on completion. Completion means a good faith effort to write substantial notes, not just that you upload a few lines of text.

# 1st Drafts:

The goal of the 1st draft is to give your peer reviewer all they need to help you turn in a perfect final draft.  What that means will depend on you and your partner, but in general, the more complete your work the better the feedback you will receive. Assessment will be based on your partner's accountability reports.

# Final drafts:
This is the source of feedback you'll receive from the graders if your work is assessed as unsatisfactory. These are things you should do to receive a satisfactory mark. You have one chance to revise and resubmit.
* Write as if you are explaining to someone else how to solve the problem, explaining when and why you do each step
* The basic goal here is two-fold (1) to make it easy for someone else looking at your work to identify what you are doing and why, and what your results mean, and (2) to force you to articulate in words how you solved the problem (writing is thinking, and this adds more scaffolding to the knowledge you're creating in your brain.)
* Your solutions should include approximately as many sentences as equations.
* Whenever you create a variable name for the sake of a problem (Theta, F12, a, etc) you should state what that means because it will not be the same for everyone.
* Say a few leading words about your approach to solving the problem, e.g. "Taking coulomb's law and integrating it for each differential piece of charge across the arc."
* Write a few words about how you get from one equation to the next, e.g. "take the log of both sides", "doing a Taylor series", "assuming x is much larger than a", etc
* Write the symbolic form of the equation before you substitute any values into it
* Show which values you plugged into the equation to get your final answer.
* Show how the units work out in your final answer. This is easier if you keep things symbolic as long as you can, and then only substitute in the values at the end of the problems.

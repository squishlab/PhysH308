# Textbook:
Classical Mechanics by John R. Taylor (required) and other excerpts provided by the instructor. The textbook by Taylor gives an excellent treatment of classical mechanics. It is well written in an informal style that lends itself well to self study - for those that took 309 using the textbook by Griffiths, Taylor is often called "Griffiths for mechanics." Later in the semester we'll draw more heavily upon other texts (provided by the instructor/library), especially for our study of fluid mechanics. Most prominently, we'll use readings from Lautrup's Physics of Continuous Matter. If that is a subject that interests you, Lautraup's book (often used in fluids courses in mechanical engineering programs) is worth purchasing as a reference, and should be available in the bookstore, but I don't require you to secure a copy for the class.

# Course Structure:

*Class content:*
Classical mechanics is one of the more mature branches of physics we teach at the 300-level - indeed, it's the very first thing you see in our major sequence, since the topics covered in 101/105 (Newton's Laws, conservation, etc) are the foundations of classical mechanics.

To solve problems in mechanics, Newton and Leibniz (in parallel) developed the fundamentals of calculus.
Over the intervening 235 years, numerous clever applications of mathematical formalism and physical reasoning have produced a catalog of powerful analytic tools for modeling mechanical systems.
Over the course of the semester, you will learn to utilize these tools to solve mechanics problems and also develop a clear understanding of how the mathematical formalism relates to the physical concepts and interpretations.

*Course format:*
My fundamental assumption in teaching this course is that you're here to learn and grow as a physicist.
The class is structured in a manner that encourages individual study, reflection, group work and discussion, iteration, and communication -- all excellent tools for intellectual and professional growth.
While I provide structure and resources to support your learning, the learning itself is your responsibility, and will be hard work.
Effective participation in the class requires a commitment to keep up with the assigned work, but also that you consistently and meaningfully contribute in class.

Collaboration is absolutely critical for success in science!
One of the major barriers to becoming a thriving physicist is the myth of the lone, brilliant physicist.
In actuality, _every_ important contribution in physics has been the product of a community of scholars.
Our understanding and creativity is deepened when we work together, especially when "we" includes a breadth of perspectives and experiences.
Failure to engage constructively and meaningfully in the group work in this course will undermine your learning, and that of your peers.

The basic cycle of the class is this:
 - Before each class meeting there will be readings and problems assigned for you to review
 - During each class you will
      - take part in discussion about the content of the readings and problem sets
      - work with a group of your peers to develop solutions to your assigned problems
 - After each class you will reflect, synthesize, and write-up what you've learned as a detailed set of solutions for assigned problem sets
 - You will provide and receive peer feedback on your write-up, and have the opportunity to revise your work before submitting it for grading
 - Each problem will be assessed as either "satisfactory" ("S") or "revise and resubmit" ("RR"). If marked "RR", you will receive an explanation of the rationale for the mark.
 - Written work marked "RR" can be resubmitted once, within one week of when it is returned. Alternatively, work may be submitted up to one week late with no opportunity to revise and resubmit. Late and resubmitted work will be marked either "S" or "U" (for Unsatisfactory).

The basic workflow of a week in this course is laid out in [Weekly Workflow](/PhysH308/weekly)

My assessment of your learning in the course will be based on your successful completion of the assigned problem sets and your performance on 24 exam questions over the course of the semester.
You will be assigned approximately 12 problem sets, and will have the opportunity to attempt up to 108 exam problems.
Details of my assessment scheme are shared in [Assessment](/PhysH308/assessment)

*Class meetings:*
Each class meeting I'll use the beginning of class (15-45 minutes) to summarize and discuss the day's topics, readings, and problems.  My goal will be to contextualize the problem solving we do through the classwork (in-class work with your peers) and other coursework (out-of-class), highlight interesting and important concepts and ideas, and to provoke some critical thinking, enhanced with discussion prompts and conceptual problems.  The next 45-60 minutes of class will consist of group collaboration on the week's homework problems. For the last 15-30 minutes we'll come back together and share the progress we've made on the problems.

# Acknowledgements:
I owe thanks to Andrea Lommen and Kate Daniel, from whom I adapted the format of this class. Additionally the structure of this website was forked from the page for Andrea's 2022 iteration of Phys H309.

I also owe thanks to many people for their influence on how I assess student progress in this course: Brett Mulligan (HC Classics) was the first colleague to make me want to try specifications grading. Since then, discussions with various colleagues have impacted how I think about assessment, grades, and student learning. The grading scheme for this particular course is based on an implementation of specifications grading used by Prof. Eric Jensen at Swarthmore College. 

We all owe many thanks to Paul Thorman for the demos he provides, and his considerable work lugging materials across campus so it's ready for us in the classroom!

I also owe thanks to Dan Grin for a wealth of course materials which I'll be draw upon occasionally throughout the semester - problems for group and individual investigation both in and out of the class, demos, lecture notes, and so on.

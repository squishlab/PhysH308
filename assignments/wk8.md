## Reading:  
Taylor, Chapter 8

This week - Central forces! This chapter will cover how to use the Lagrangian formalism you learned last week for problems such as orbiting bodies and springs.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the coursework evaluation checklist).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context, and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

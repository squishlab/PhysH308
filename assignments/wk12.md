## Reading:  
Review Taylor, Chapter 13.6
Read Taylor, Chapter 13.7 if you're interested!

This week - more Hamiltonians

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the Expectations page).

## Schedule changes for the week:
 - No office hours
 - First copy of HW 12 due Monday, Dec. 2 end of day

## Assignment:
# For class on Tuesday:

1. 13.26
2. 13.27

Only write up 13.26! 13.27 is just for class, and foreshadows fluids.

# For Thursday: happy Thanksgiving!

# Independent problems (due Tuesday Dec. 3):
 - *C4:* Explain the steps you'd take to solve for the motion of a ballistic projectile using each of Newton's 2nd law $$F=ma$$, the Lagrangian $$\mathcal{L}$$, and the Hamiltonian $$\mathcal{H}$$. You don't need to actually solve it! Just state what equations and procedure you'd use to solve for $$x(t)$$ and $$y(t)$$.
 - *C5:* A comet orbits the sun in a highly eccentric (but closed) orbit. Where in the orbit are each of the comet's speed and angular momentum greatest and least?

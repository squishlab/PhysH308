## Reading:  
Taylor, Chaps. 9.3-5 and Chapters 10.1-5

This week - Rotating bodies. You're gonna learn about the physics of tops and other cool things. Fair warning: 10.3 may be a little tough, but you'll get some review of this on Thursday.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the Expectations page).

## Assignment:

# For class on Tuesday:
1. 10.14 -- The answer to 10.11(b) will be provided at the beginning of class, which may help!
2. 10.22(a)

# For class on Thursday:

1. 10.22(b), then confirm that your results are consistent with the expected results of problem 10.24
2. 10.37 (note the result of 10.23) *We're pushing this problem to Assignment #10*
   

# Independent problems (Due Friday, Nov 15):
Consider the atwood machine below. All 3 masses may move as constrained by the machine.
1. *Will complete Q2 if you haven't yet* Express the Lagrangian for the system in terms of only x and y (the heights of the two rightmost masses relative to the pictured positions).
2. *In combination with part 1, this completes Q3* Write the equations of motion for both coordinates from the Lagrangian (you don't need $x(t),y(t)$, just equations equivalent to Newton's 2nd Law).
3. *This completes R2* Write the generalized forces and momenta for this system. Next week you'll revisit these terms in the context of Noether's theorem!

# If you want a preview, we'll be looking at the following problems next week (with demos/toys!):

1. 10.42
2. 10.43
3. 10.52

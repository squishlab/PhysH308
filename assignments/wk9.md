## Reading:  
Taylor, Chaps. 9.3-5 and Chapters 10.1-5

This week - Rotating bodies. You're gonna learn about the physics of tops and other cool things. Fair warning: 10.3 may be a little tough, but you'll get some review of this on Thursday.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the Expectations page).

Reading: Taylor, Chapters 1-2. The reading notes for week 1, but you should try to read Chap. 1 before class Wednesday, and Chap. 2 before class Friday.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the coursework evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

1. Taylor Ex 1.6
*Main point: This problem will serve as a review of vector math and how to switch between polar and cartesian coordinates.*

Recall
$$
\vec{x}\equiv\left|\vec{x}\right|\hat{x}
$$

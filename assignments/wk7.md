## Reading:  
Taylor, 7.5-7.10, excluding 7.9 (magnetism)

As you come back from Fall break, I recommend reviewing examples from chapter 7.1-4 to refresh your memory on Langrangians

# Assignment:
You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see "expectations").

## Reading:  
Taylor, Chapters 1-2. Given the odd constraints for the class this week, the *Reading Notes* for week 1 are due Wednesday at 11:59 PM, and you should try to read Chaps. 1-2 before class Wednesday. Our emphasis in class will be chapter 1.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the coursework evaluation checklist for them).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning/make sense points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context,
and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

## Problems 
# For class Wednesday: 

1. Newton's first law -- Taylor Ex 1.26 and 1.27  
Main point: These problems will serve as a review of vector math and how to switch between polar and cartesian coordinates. They also are a good review of reference frames and reminder of fictitious forces.  Being able to solve problems in different frames, and to switch between frames, is an incredibly powerful tool for analysis.

2. Newton's second law -- Taylor Ex 1.35   
Main point:  This is probably the one of Newton's laws with which you have the most recent and extensive practice, $$F=m\ddot{x}$$, so this is a straightforward practice problem on balistic motion, and a good chance to practice writing up clear and well-explained solutions. 

3. Newton's third law -- Taylor Ex 1.28   
Main point: This problem is a fun one, as it's an example of how conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of the 3rd law!  If you want another example, 1.31 is also a fun one.  
This is also a good opportunity to practice [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation), which is useful shorthand for summation over indices.  $y=\sum_i x_i$ becomes $y=x_i$.  With multiple indices we have $$y=\sum_{i,j}x_i x_j$$ becomes $$y=x_i x_j$$.  We also use the kroenecker delta function
$$
\delta_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
            1, &         \text{if } i=j,\\
            0, &         \text{if } i\neq j.
    \end{cases}
$$
and the Levi-Cevita symbol
$$
\epsilon_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
            1, &         \text{if } (i,j)=(1,2),\\
            -1, &        \text{if } (i,j)=(2,1),\\
            0, &         \text{if } i=j.
    \end{cases}
$$
to make sums like $$y=\sum_{i\neq j}x_i x_j=\epsilon_{ij}x_i x_j$$.

# For class Friday: 

Choose a problem in Taylor’s Problems Section 1.2-1.3, Problem 2.18, Problem 2.33, Problem 2.34, Section 2.6 that leverages a mathematical tool you feel unclear or out-of-practice with. Solve the problem, explain the assumptions and relevance to physics in a short paragraph. Come prepared to discuss with your group on Friday. We will have each group choose one problem to explain and present in a recitation or class. You need only include your individually chosen problem (as opposed to the one selected by your group) for your submitted written work.

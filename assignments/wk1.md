Learning goals: C1, Q1, Q2, R1
## Reading:  
Taylor, Chapters 1-2. Given the odd constraints for the class this week, the *Reading Notes* for week 1 are due Thursday at 11:59 PM, and you should try to read Chaps. 1-2 before class on Thursday. Our emphasis in class will be chapter 1.

Bonus "reading": these great, old "frames of reference" videos:

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while
you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the coursework evaluation checklist for them).

## Problems 
# For class Tuesday: 

1. Newton's first law -- Taylor Ex 1.26 and 1.27. Stretch goal: 1.46 (polar coordinates)
Main point: These problems will serve as a review of vector math and how to switch between polar and cartesian coordinates. They also are a good review of reference frames and reminder of fictitious forces.  Being able to solve problems in different frames, and to switch between frames, is an incredibly powerful tool for analysis.

2. Staticity -- The sliding book problem, shared in class. The text of the problem can be found on the final page of the [Slides from Tuesday](lectures/firstday_308_2024.pdf)

Main point: this is a good review of staticity and vector math. Additionally, it is essentially an extension of the classic incline plane problem, but because of the new context many students find it challenging.  Figuring out how to map new problems onto familiar abstractions is a quintessentially physics-y strategy for problem solving!

3. Newton's second law -- Taylor Ex 1.35   
Main point:  This is probably the one of Newton's laws with which you have the most recent and extensive practice, $$F=m\ddot{x}$$, so this is a straightforward practice problem on balistic motion, and a good chance to practice writing up clear and well-explained solutions. 

# For class Thursday:
1. Newton's third law -- Taylor Ex 1.28   
Main point: This problem is a fun one, as it's an example of how conservation of momentum is a direct consequence of the 3rd law!  If you want another example, 1.31 is also a fun one.  
This is also a good opportunity to practice [Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation), which is useful shorthand for summation over indices.  For example, recall that the dot product of $$x$$ and $$y$$ is defined as $$\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = \sum_{i}x_i y_i = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + x_3y_3$$. With Einstein notation, this becomes $$x_iy_i$$. For cross products, $$\vec{x} \times \vec{y} = \epsilon_{ijk}x_jy_k$$, with

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} =
    \begin{cases}
            1, &         \text{if } (i,j,k) \, \text{is an even permutation of (1,2,3)}\\
            -1, &        \text{if } (i,j,k) \, \text{is an odd permutation of (1,2,3)}\\
            0, &         \text{if any of (i,j,k) are the same number}.
    \end{cases}
$$

which is more compact and often easier to work with than the determinate definition.


2. Choose ONE problem in Taylorâ€™s Problems Section 1.2-1.3, Problem 2.18, Problem 2.33, Problem 2.34, or Section 2.6 that leverages a mathematical tool you feel unclear or out-of-practice with. Solve the problem, explain the assumptions and relevance to physics in a short paragraph. Come prepared to discuss with your group and present one of your problems to the class. You need only include your individually chosen problem (as opposed to the one selected by your group) for your submitted written work.

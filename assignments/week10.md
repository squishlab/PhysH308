## Reading:  
Taylor, Chapters 10.6-10

This week - More rotating bodies. You're gonna learn about the physics of tops and other cool things.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the Expectations page).

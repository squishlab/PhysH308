## Reading:  
Taylor, Chapters 10.6-10

This week - More rotating bodies. You're gonna learn about the physics of tops and other cool things.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the Expectations page).

## Assignment:

# For class on Tuesday:
1. ~~10.37 -- continued from last week - a very dangerous frisbee!~~ Covered in class.
2. 10.42 -- Book is frisbee!

# For class on Thursday:
We're going to cover Euler Angles.  I think this is a tricky enough set of concepts we're going to change the originally planned problems to something that better helps us connect this formalism to concepts from earlier in the class!
1. 10.51 -- Nutation of a top!
2. ~~10.43 -- More frisbee!~~
3. ~~10.52 -- A spinning top.  If I ruined frisbees for you, this will make frisbees fun again.~~

# Reading:  
Consider problem 6.10 (the situation described should seem familiar after working through 6.16)
Taylor, 7.1-7.4


# Assignment:
You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see "expectations").

## For class on Tuesday:
1. 6.19 (if your book says "for which the surface area is stationary", it should say "for which the surface area is minimum")
2. 7.2

## For class on Thursday:
1. 7.10
2. 7.11

## Extra practice problem (not graded/required): ##
1. 6.9
2. 7.6
3. 7.12 (Think back to Tuesday's lecture -- where would friction go in the derivation? This looks like the sort of exam question I could ask for C3...)

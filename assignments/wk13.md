This week: Fluids! Steady and ideal flows.

You may work together and get help from other students. Your solutions must be written in your own words, without looking at someone else's solutions while you write them.

Don't forget the criteria we are looking for in your solutions (see the coursework evaluation checklist).

In order to make sure you get your context and meaning points,
next to your answers, please put a “c” with a circle around it for context, and an “m” with a circle around it for meaning.

# Assignment:
## Wednesday:
1. Lautraup: 12.1. First answer the problem for the case $${\vec{v}}(\vec{x},t)=(a,b,0)$$.
2. Lautrup: 12.6. Also answer: what must the slope of the stream be in order to maintain its constant depth?

## Friday:
1. *Bernoulli near your car:* You're driving in your car and trying out a new barometer. Most of the windows are closed, but one is open a little. There is no wind. You find that, when the car is moving at 105 km/h, the pressure inside drops by 667 Pa. Assume a density of air of 1.21 $$\mathrm{kg~m}^3$$.
     - What is the speed of the air just outside the window relative to the car, expressed in km/h? (Hint: the correct answer is not 105 km/h.)
     - Explain why this is so, qualitatively.
2. *Bernoulli near your faucet:* Water flows out of a kitchen faucet of 1.25 cm diameter at the rate 0.1 L/s. The bottom of the sink is 45 cm below the faucet outlet.
     - Will the cross-sectional area of the fluid stream increase, decrease, or remain constant between the faucet outlet and the bottom of the sink? Explain qualitatively.
     - Find the cross-sectional area of the stream as a function of distance y above the sink bottom, and plot it.
     - If a plate is held directly under the faucet, find the force required to hold the plate in a horizontal position as a function of y and plot it.

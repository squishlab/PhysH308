Here's how I calculate the grades:

Reading Notes 20%

First Draft Solutions 15%

Pretty Copy Solutions 15%

Quizzes 20%

Peer and Self Evaluations: 15%

Participation 15%

**Participation:**

There is a participation component for this class. You start at 100% for participation.
If you are consistently late or absent without good reason and especially if you do not give timely feedback to your collaborator(s), you will lose credit.
If you disrupt your classmates' learning, you will lose credit.
When you present solutions or contribute to discussion during class, contribute within your group, and provide impactful peer feedback, you will earn back credit, but it is much harder to earn back credit than to lose it.
The reason for this policy is that this course is designed to build strong collaborations and that requires trust and reliability.

# [Sept. 12]: An announcement from the IDEA seminar organizers
Hi all - a reminder that we need ~4 new PAID student organizers for the IDEA seminar organization. In a nutshell, IDEA seminar works to promote inclusive behavior in all dept spaces (class, lounge, office hours to hear student concerns) and build awareness by all students of challenges and constructive paths of improvement in creating better environments to support scientists/science students of all identities. Here is a URL to apply for the job, https://forms.gle/9NovjjNMzKhfDJ6H9 - please ask any of the faculty if you are interested.


# [Aug. 30]: GUAP (Genders Underrepresented in Astronomy and Physics) is looking for new board members:  
GUAP is a club of non-men in any physics class with the goal of providing a community space for underrepresented genders to come together and make connections. It has historically held dinners with Tiffin food for community building or had speakers come in and talk about areas of interest to club members. Running the club is a collaborative effort, but doesn't require much - just the ability to coordinate dinners, get the word out through emails and flyers, and be in contact with Dori about refunds and that sort of thing.

If you're interested in serving on the board, please email Eva White: ewhite3 'at' haverford.edu

# What you should expect in our classroom and the physics department.

* honoring difference...all the differences you can think of
* integrity



# GUAP (Genders Underrepresented in Astronomy and Physics) is looking for new board members:  
GUAP is a club of non-men in any physics class with the goal of providing a community space for underrepresented genders to come together and make connections. It has historically held dinners with Tiffin food for community building or had speakers come in and talk about areas of interest to club members. Running the club is a collaborative effort, but doesn't require much - just the ability to coordinate dinners, get the word out through emails and flyers, and be in contact with Dori about refunds and that sort of thing.

If you're interested in serving on the board, please email Eva White: ewhite3 'at' haverford.edu

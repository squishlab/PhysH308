*Instructor:*  Ted Brzinski, KINSC L109, tbrzinski 'at' haverford 'dot' edu

*Textbook:*  Classical Mechanics by John R. Taylor (required) and other excerpts provided by the instructor. The textbook by Taylor gives an excellent treatment of classical mechanics. It is well written in an informal style that lends itself well to self study - for those that took 309 using the textbook by Griffiths, Taylor is often called "Griffiths for mechanics." Later in the semester we'll draw more heavily upon other texts (provided by the instructor/library), especially for our study of fluid mechanics. Most prominently, we'll use readings from Lautrup's Physics of Continuous Matter. If that is a subject that interests you, Lautraup's book (often used in fluids courses in mechanical engineering programs) is worth purchasing as a reference, and should be available in the bookstore, but I don't require you to secure a copy for the class.

# Course Structure:
I owe thanks to Andrea Lommen and Kate Daniel, from whom I adapted the format of this course. Much of this website was forked directly from the page for Andrea's 2022 iteration of Phys H309. I believe much of the text about class format on this page was originally written by Kate.

I also owe thanks to Dan Grin for a wealth of course materials which I'll be drawing upon throughout the semester - problems for group and individual investigation both in and out of the class, demos, lecture notes, and so on.

*Class meetings:*
Each Monday I'll use the first 30-40 minutes of class to summarize the prior week's topics, the weekend's readings, and what we'll learn in the present week.  My goal will be to contextualize the problem solving we do through the classwork (in-class work with your peers) and other coursework (out-of-class), highlight interesting and important concepts and ideas, and to provide some fodder for group discourse in the form of some discussion prompts and conceptual problems.  The next 15 minutes of class will consist of group- and class-wide discussion, then for the last 5-15 minutes we'll come back together and share the fruits of our group discussions.

The format of each W/Fr class will be a very short (5-10 min) review highlighting the points of your reading relevant to the group problems for the day. The rest of the time will be devoted to collaborative problem solving. Since not all the relevant material will be covered in lectures, it is essential that the assigned reading be completed each Monday.

*Class content:*
Classical mechanics is one of the more mature branches of physics we teach at the 300-level - indeed, it's the very first thing you see in our major sequence, since the topics covered in 101/105 (Newton's Laws, conservation, etc) are the foundations of classical mechanics. [Some words about open questions and relevance to active research.

To solve problems in mechanics, Newton and Leibniz (in parallel) developed the fundamentals of calculus.
Over the intervening 235 years, numerous clever applications of mathematical formalism and physical reasoning have produced a catalog of powerful analytic tools for modeling mechanical systems.
Over the course of the semester, you will learn to utilize these tools to solve mechanics problems and also develop a clear understanding of how the mathematical formalism relates to the physical concepts at hand.

*Class format:*
The pedagogy for this course is designed to lead you toward realizing your best inner
physicist. I will provide a strong scaffolding and support for you to make steady progress.
In order to succeed, you must consistently (and persistently) do the reading, practice the
mathematical tools, review what you did, put it back into the context of the reading,
practice some more, and review again. We will be making several passes at the material
with the aim of deeply learning the subject matter.

Collaboration is also absolutely critical for success! One of the major barriers to
becoming a thriving physicist is the myth of the lone, brilliant physicist. This is not how it
happens, not even for Einstein. Our understanding and creativity is deepened when we
work together. To do this effectively, we must build trust in each other so that we can be
vulnerable enough to openly and constructively embrace the discomfort of not knowing.
Practically speaking, this means that we will work many of the problems in class and in
collaborative groups outside of class. You are independently responsible for doing the
reading before you arrive. Over the semester you will produce a set of notes and
completed problems called PRETTY COPIES. You will use these PRETTY COPIES for the
QUIZZES. 

Here is the specific process we will go through for each topic:

 - Before Class:

      - Reading & Notes: Reading assignments are due on Monday each week as listed on the grid (see tab above)
It is required that you do the reading before class and take notes! As you read, take the time to stop and think, what does this mean? Do I really understand this step? Could I explain it to my classmates if they are confused? The reading should be your main focus before class. Your notes do not have to be beautiful and they do not have to be perfect, just functional and thoughtful. On Moodle there will be an assignment called READING NOTES where you should submit a single PDF of your notes. These are typically due at 11:59 PM on Mondays.

      - Problem Sets: Each week’s readings has an associated problem set listed under PROBLEMS in the GRID. Take some time to look at these before you get to class, but you do not need to complete them. However, you should think about them and jot down a framework for solving each problem.

 - In Class Work:

      - Weekly Discussions: Each Monday we will begin class with a 15-35 minute lecture, followed by 25-45 minutes of Q&A, small group discussions, tutorial demonstrations, and other participatory activities. The purpose of these class meetings will be synthesize the readings and the prior week's coursework, provide an opportunity for informal discussion, and to develop the context for the work we do in class on Wednesdays and Fridays.


      - Pre-Class Summary: I will begin each W/F class with a brief (5ish minute), mini lecture to summarize the major points from the reading. The purpose of this is to make sure we are all on the same page, allow time for general questions, and to place the topics covered in the reading into the big picture context. I will try not to give a lecture that repeats what is in the readings.

      - Problem Set Discussion: On W/F, we will spend the majority of class collaborating on the problem sets and developing problem solving strategies. I will ask each of you (at some point or another) to present your group’s work so we can discuss your group’s proposed strategies as a class. There is no single way to solve most physics problems. These in class sessions will provide the foundation for later collaborative and independent work.

 - After Class:

      - First Draft Solutions: After strategizing each problem in class, you will need to submit a single PDF of your FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS to that week’s problem set in two places: (1) on Moodle and (2) to your collaborator (described below). Do NOT spend hours working on these. FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS should be a tidied up version of what you’ve worked out in class already. It may be useful to meet with your collaborator(s) to clarify what we talked about. However, as soon as you’ve done this initial work, submit it. I grade FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS by simply looking to see if you’ve written down your thoughts for each problem while they are fresh. I expect there to be something substantial written for each problem since we talk about each problem in class. In fact, there won’t always be time for much more than this since your FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS are due by Friday evening at 11:59 PM.

      - Collaborators: Throughout the semester, you will be matched with a Collaborator (or few) with whom you can bounce ideas off of, compare notes, and who will also provide you with feedback on your FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS. You will need to schedule a regular time to meet with your Collaborator each week. When your collaborator gives you their FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS, you will have to give feedback to your Collaborator before the end of the next day weekday. This is a relatively simple task, but incredibly helpful for your collaborator. On Moodle there is a document called the PEER EVALUATION FORM. This is a simple rubric for you to use to evaluate each problem from your collaborator’s FIRST DRAFT SOLUTIONS. Once you complete the PEER EVALUATION FORM for each problem, give it to your Collaborator to help them identify where to focus for their PRETTY COPY SOLUTIONS. Then, when submitting your reading notes the following Monday, complete the COLLABORATION PEER EVALUATION quiz on Moodle. This practice has many purposes, but more than anything it is meant to help build a supportive community between peers that you can lean on throughout your time at Haverford (and after!). 

      - Pretty Copy Solutions: Once you have strategized each problem on your own, discussed in class, submitted a first draft, and received feedback from your Collaborator you should feel like you understand every step of each problem very well. On your own, write a PRETTY COPY of each of your solutions — show all steps, explain all steps, reference equations used, and put it in context. These are due at 11:59 PM on Wednesday. These will be the only resource allowed during QUIZZES!

      - Quizzes: I will assign a quiz once every week or so on Thursdays as indicated on the SCHEDULE. These will open on Moodle at 12:01 AM and close at 11:59 PM. These are the only thing that you are expected to do independently. They are short assessments that focus on conceptual understanding and completion of the PRETTY COPY SOLUTIONS. You will have 15 minutes to complete the quiz. The only resource you are allowed to use for these is your PRETTY COPY SOLUTION or READING NOTES as indicated for each problem in the QUIZ. Do not discuss the QUIZ until the day after it is due.

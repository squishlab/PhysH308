*The following statement is adapted from recommended language from the college, and I fully endorse it:*

Haverford College is committed to partnering with you on your academic and intellectual journey.  I recognize that your ability to thrive academically can be impacted by your personal well-being and that stressors may impact you over the course of the semester.  If the stressors are academic, I welcome the opportunity to discuss and address those stressors with you in order to find solutions together.  If you are experiencing challenges or questions related to emotional health, finances, physical health, relationships, learning strategies or differences, or other potential stressors, I hope you will consider reaching out to the many resources available on campus, as well as any trusted mentors and personal confidants. Campus resources include CAPS (free and unlimited counseling is available), the Office of Academic Resources, Health Services, Professional Health Advocate, Religious and Spiritual Life, the Office of Multicultural Affairs, the GRASE Center, and the Dean’s Office.  Additional information can be found at https://www.haverford.edu/deans-office-student-life/offices-resources.

Additionally, Haverford College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body and providing equal access to students with a disability. If you have (or think you have) a learning difference or disability – including mental health, medical, or physical impairment – please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services (ADS) at hc-ads@haverford.edu. The Director will confidentially discuss the process to establish reasonable accommodations.  It is never too late to request accommodations – our bodies and circumstances are continuously changing. 

Students who have already been approved to receive academic accommodations and want to use their accommodations in this course should share their accommodation letter and make arrangements to meet with me as soon as possible to discuss how their accommodations will be implemented in this course. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice in order to successfully implement.

If, at any point in the semester, a disability or personal circumstances affect your learning in this course, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I want to be sure you are aware of the full range of resources and options available to you.


*In addition to the statement above, I want to express a few additional things*

A common, high-impact, easily implemented accommodation is recording of class meetings. I am, preemptively, planning to record all of our class meetings using Zoom. The zoom link and recordings will be available to anyone who is unable to attend class in-person, or who want to review events of the class. Zoom should not be treated as an alternative to attending lecture, only a poor substitute when *absolutely* necessary or (the recordings) as a study aid, but all students should know that class meetings will be recorded, and that they will have access to those recordings.

I don't like grading. There are good [arguments against using grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/). 
I would prefer to focus on qualitative feedback and completion of deliverables, which is far more consistent with how you'll be measured once you graduate.
I'm required to grade you. You are incentivized to receive grades.
That's not fair, so I think I should try to subvert the practice of arbitrary numerical ranking in whatever way I can without causing harm to you and your classmates.
My assessment scheme for this class is an attempt to do so.
We are essentially doing specifications grading, based on an implementation by Swarthmore prof. Eric Jensen.

I grade weird.  Please read this page to understand what that means.

Your grade will be determined by a combination of how much of the regular course work you've [completed](/PhysH308/writeup), and how well you demonstrate your completion
of our course learning standards.  The detailed mapping to the 4.0 scale follows at the bottom of this page.


# Learning standards for Phys H308
These are the ideas, concepts and skills that will be assessed in exams for this class.
Most are statements of tasks you should be able to complete. 
Italicized text denotes concepts or terminology you will learn over the course of the semester.

If you can do all of these things and have a deep understanding of the terminology, you probably shouldn't be in this class.
The point of the class is to help you gain those abilities.  You can't gain something you already have.

The goals are categorized into physical concepts (C), quantitative problem solving skills (Q), and physical reasoning (R).  Goals marked with an asterisk (*) may change over the course of the semester, based on discussion and feedback with the class:

Conceptual:
 - C1: Demonstrate understanding of Newton's laws and their implications for motion
 - C2: What makes a force conservative, both in terms of work and potential?
 - C3: Demonstrate a conceptual understanding of "the action" and calculus of variations
 - C4: Explain the relationship between the Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian frameworks
 - C5*: Demonstrate a qualitative understanding of the Kepler orbits.
 - C6*: Explain the principal axes of inertia and the intermediate axis theorem 
 - C7*: Explain, in the context of Hamiltonian Mechanics, ignorable coordinates and canonical transformations.
 - C8*: Apply continuity to predict the behaviour of fluid flows
 
Quantitative:
 - Q1a: Solve for the forces involved in the staticity of a system in the Newtonian framework 
 - Q1b: Solve for the motion of a body in the Newtonian framework (using Newton's Laws and conservation of momentum)
 - Q2: Solve problems using curvilinear coordinate systems.
 - Q3: Find the equations of motion for a system in a Lagrangian framework.
 - Q4: Correctly calculate and interpret forces of constraint in a lagrangian framework
 - Q5*: Solve for the orbit of a body subject to a central gravitational force
 - Q6*: Calculate the motion of a rotating solid body in both the body and lab frames 
 - Q7a*: Find the stresses in a continuum material at rest (hydrostatics)
 - Q7b*: Find the equations of motion for ideal fluid flow in simple geometries (hydrodynamics)
 
Reasoning:
 - R1: Explicitly relate the conservation of energy and momentum to Newton's Laws
 - R2: Demonstrate proficiency in identifying and interpretting generalized momenta
 - R3: Relate the symmetries of the Lagrangian to conserved quantities
 - R4*: Utilize the center of mass coordinate system to simplify central force problems
 - R5*: Explain the precession of a spinning top
 - R6*: Predict the qualitative differences between a fluid system in the laminar vs inertial limits
 

# Assessing learning standards
Starting at the end of Week 2, I will post an exam which tests key concepts from the recent material,
often related to the homework from the week before. These will generally (not always) include problems testing one
standard from each of the categories above.
 - You must work on these problems independently, like an open-book, open-note exam problem. You may discuss the
 problems with me in office hours, but only for clarification. You may not use online resources or texts not used in the class.
 - You should use the same general principles for communication that you practice for your final draft homeworks -- 
 see [Homework expectations here](PhysH308/writeup) -- in order to clearly communicate your work and understanding, though assessment
 will be based only on correctness (and effective communication thereof).
 - Each problem will either be marked "correct" or "incorrect" with a brief explanation. There is no chance to revise and resubmit.
 - If you receive an "incorrect mark", you will have a chance to work a related problem addressing the same learning goal as an optional add-on
 with every subsequent exam. You only need to correctly answer one exam problem addressing each of the learning standards.
 - There may be alternative methods offered to demonstrate completion of some learning standards (e.g., optional oral exams, independent projects). 

## Mapping to your final grade:

| Grade | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:-----:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  4.0  | Earn a Successful score on all homework assignments AND Earn a Successful score on all but 1 learning standards AND Complete all peer assessments OR all quizzes (but at least 70% of both)                              |
|  3.3  | Earn a Successful score on all but 1 homework assignment AND Earn a Successful score on at least 80% of learning standards AND Complete all peer assessments and 70% of quizzes            |
|  2.7  | Earn a Successful score on at least 50% of the homework assignments AND Earn a Successful score on at least 70% of learning standards AND Complete all peer assessments and 50% of quizzes |
|  2.0  | Earn a Successful score on at least 50% of the homework assignments AND Earn a Successful score on at least 50% of learning standards AND Complete all peer assessments.                   |

If you complete all of the criteria for a grade, and 2 of the criteria for the next grade category, you will automatically move up to an intermediate score (e.g., 3.3 becomes a 3.7).
If you complete only one of the criteria from the next category, you may move up to an intermediate score at the discretion of the instructor - generally based on partial completion of the other 2 criteria
(e.g., successfully complete a 3.3., successfully complete all homeworks, AND succeed at all but 2 learning standards, AND complete all but 1 of the quizzes).

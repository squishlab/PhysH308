# Statement of Classroom Values and Accessibility

In academics, we should strive to have everyone learn and thrive as part of a shared intellectual community. Let’s work together to make our diversity a strength and resource! Come prepared to engage in vigorous and active collaboration. Respect your classmates by working to ensure everyone’s access to class resources, amplifying your classmates' voices, engaging with their ideas, and sharing your own observations and ideas! I want to see all of you learn, thrive, and contribute to your fullest. I work hard to create an accessible and active learning environment. In that spirit, I am committed to working with each of you to provide necessary individual accommodations and support – don’t hesitate to request a meeting to discuss such measures with me at any point in the semester! 
 
If you are experiencing challenges or questions related to health (including mental and emotional health), finances, relationships, learning differences, or other stressors, I also want you to know about the other resources available on campus. Many of these resources may be found via the student life webpage: https://www.haverford.edu/student-life
One of the resources most relevant to navigating challenges in the classroom is the office of Access and Disability Services (ADS; https://www.haverford.edu/access-and-disability-services). I urge you to read this statement from ADS, and let me know if you need help or advice about negotiating this process.

> Haverford College is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body and provides equitable access to students with disabilities. If you have (or think you may have) a disability related to mental health, chronic health, neurological state, and/or physical condition, please contact the Office of Access and Disability Services (ADS) at hc-ads@haverford.edu. It is never too late to request ADA accommodations – our bodies and circumstances are continuously changing. Please know that all inquiries and health-related information is handled in a sensitive and confidential manner.
> Students who have already been approved to receive academic ADA accommodations and want to use these in this course should share their accommodation letter and make arrangements to meet with me as soon as possible to discuss how their accommodations will be implemented in this course. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice in order to successfully implement.

We are also aware that your lives do not start and end at the door to the classroom, and that you may encounter difficulties that are not the purview of ADS. Some such circumstances do still merit accommodation. If you are experiencing any such circumstances, please make an appointment to discuss your situation with one of us or another appropriate advocate (CAPS, your dean, OAR, etc.) and seek help. We strive to create a safe and supportive learning environment: while we cannot promise special accommodations for every circumstance, we will listen without personal judgment, work with you to develop strategies to address your situation, and strive to direct you to whatever resources might be available.

# Illness-related issues

 - Q:  I’m not sure how sick I have to feel before I should miss class or lab or deadlines for homework, lab reports, or exams.  What do you advise?

 - A: You will not be penalized for keeping your classmates and instructors and their families and close circles safe from infection – immediately reach out to your instructors to inform us if you are missing a class meeting due to illness, and we will coordinate to help you remain engaged and up-to-date in the course.

 - Q:  What if a healthcare provider recommends I isolate or enter quarantine, but I am not incapacitated (either due to COVID-19 or another illness)?

 - A:  You should contact your instructors immediately. We have lots of experience with such situations over the past few years, and we will work with you to create a customized plan that will help you stay engaged with the course even while isolating.

# Title IX reporting obligations and harassment

I am committed to fostering a safe and inclusive learning environment where everyone feels secure and free from harassment. Harassment or exclusion of your classmates based on gender, sexuality, ethnicity, or any other aspect of their identity will not be tolerated.
All forms of misconduct targeted on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, domestic violence, and dating violence, whether they occur on or off campus, trigger additional, federally-mandated responses under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. If you have experienced any form of gender or sex-based discrimination, harassment, or violence, know that help and support are available. Staff members are trained to support students in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, and more. 

The College strongly encourages all students to report any incidents of sexual misconduct, but I believe your decision of what to report (and to whom) should be made with full transparency and awareness. Please be aware that most Haverford employees, including Prof Ted Brzinski, are *required* by federal law to report information about such misconduct to the Bi-College Title IX Coordinator: https://www.haverford.edu/users/ktaylor4.
Listed licensed/ordained religious advisers and healthcare providers (including CAPS and Health Center staff) are obligated to treat anything you share with them in a completely confidential manner. Confidentiality in this context means that information about sexual misconduct shared by a student cannot be revealed to any other individual without the express permission of the reporting student, except where there is immediate and serious concern about the student’s safety or that of others. Specific information about which college employees you may consult confidentially can be found here: https://www.haverford.edu/sex-discrimination-and-sex-based-harassment/confidentiality-reporting/options-for-reporting
Information about the College’s Sexual Misconduct policy, reporting options, and a list of campus and local resources can be found on the College’s website: https://www.haverford.edu/sex-discrimination-and-sex-based-harassment
If you would like me to clarify any of these procedures, policies, and constraints, I am happy to meet on an individual basis.
